# Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Interface

## 📖 Project Description
This project implements a **gesture-based Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) system** that allows users to control their computer using **hand gestures**.  
Instead of relying on traditional keyboard or mouse shortcuts, users can perform simple hand signs to trigger system-level actions such as opening applications, adjusting volume, controlling media, or navigating the desktop.  

By leveraging **computer vision techniques with OpenCV** and **machine learning for gesture recognition**, this project demonstrates how **touchless interaction** can make computing more accessible, intuitive, and futuristic.  

## ✨ Features
- Real-time **hand gesture recognition** using a webcam.  
- Map gestures to **custom system shortcuts**.  
- Touch-free navigation for enhanced accessibility.  
- Extendable to add more gestures and actions.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **OpenCV** – for image processing and hand tracking.  
- **Mediapipe / TensorFlow / Scikit-learn** – for gesture recognition (depending on implementation).  
- **PyAutoGUI / OS libraries** – for executing system-level commands.  

## 🚀 Use Cases
- Quick access to common shortcuts (e.g., copy, paste, minimize).  
- Control media playback with simple gestures.  
- Accessibility support for users with limited mobility.  
- A step towards **natural and immersive HCI systems**.
